        <ul>
          <li>
            The following terms and conditions (this "Agreement") is a legal
            agreement between GoalOfferss ("GoalOfferss"), and PUBLISHER.
            PUBLISHER and GoalOfferss may also be individually referred to
            herein as a "Party" and collectively as "Parties." If there is any
            conflict between these Terms and Conditions and the Insertion
            Order(s), the Insertion Order(s) shall control.
          </li>
          <li>
            1.) Service: PUBLISHER will display the Advertisement and perform
            lead generation services described in the attached Insertion Order.
            "Advertisement" means the advertisement, including any copy
            including questions and or text ads, graphic, sound, video,
            programming code and/or other content that comprises the
            advertisement, as well as the websites to which an advertisement is
            linked if applicable. GoalOfferss hereby grants to PUBLISHER
            during the Contract Period a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide
            right and license by all means and in any media, whether now known
            or hereafter discovered, to use, reproduce, distribute, publicly
            perform, publicly display and digitally perform such Advertisement
            and all its constituent parts.
          </li>
          <li>
            2.) Qualified Lead Definition (Qualified Leads): Qualified Leads are
            prospects who meet GoalOfferss’s screening criteria as described
            in the Insertion Order and who provide their complete contact data.
            PUBLISHER will be paid on a delivered per lead basis defined as when
            a user agrees through a pre approved opt-in method to be contacted.
            In the case of any dispute between the parties as to the number of
            Qualified Leads, GoalOfferss’s numbers will control.
          </li>
          <li>
            3.) Lead Validation Procedure: <br />
            GoalOfferss will verify each Qualified Lead delivered by the
            PUBLISHER. Upon receipt, all Qualified Leads will be checked for
            data validity (i.e. containing valid data inputs for the fields
            specified in the Insertion Order) and uniqueness of data (i.e. that
            the Qualified Leads are not present in GoalOfferss’s database for
            the designated Advertisement in the past 60 days). GoalOfferss
            reserves the right to send an auto-responder to all respondents
            re-confirming their request for information. Any objections from
            respondents (about the email, or the offer) will be raised to the
            PUBLISHER.
          </li>
          <li>
            4.) Creative Changes: Editing of GoalOfferss’s Creative is
            strictly prohibited, without prior written approval from GoalOfferss. Creative includes, but is not limited to, text ads, graphic
            ads, from and subject line, any copy associated with the campaign
            including survey questions and answers. Any changes to Creative,
            without prior written permission will result in the loss of payment
            of Leads.
          </li>
          <li>
            5.) Compliance: GoalOfferss will actively monitor PUBLISHER
            activity using a combination of its proprietary software and third
            party monitoring services. It is the obligation of PUBLISHER to
            prove to GoalOfferss that they are not committing fraud. GoalOfferss will hold PUBLISHER payment in ‘Pending Status’ until
            PUBLISHER has satisfactorily provided evidence that PUBLISHER is not
            defrauding the system. GoalOfferss flags accounts that: Have
            click-through rates that are much higher than industry averages and
            where solid justification is not evident; Have only click programs
            generating clicks with no indication by site traffic that it can
            sustain the clicks reported; Have shown fraudulent leads as
            determined by our clients or Use fake redirects, automated software,
            and/or fraud to generate clicks or leads. If PUBLISHER is unable to
            prove to GoalOfferss that PUBLISHER is not committing fraud,
            PUBLISHER will forfeit its entire commission for all programs and
            PUBLISHER’s account will be terminated. GoalOfferss reserves sole
            judgment in determining fraud.
          </li>
          <li>
            6.) Advertising Guidelines: PUBLISHER may, in its complete
            discretion, reject, cancel or remove at any time any Advertisement
            from the service for any reason without prior notice to GoalOfferss. PUBLISHER must notify GoalOfferss following the
            rejection, cancellation or removal of any Advertisement from the
            service within 24 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            7.) Term &amp; Target Launch: Term will be one (1) month from the
            target launch of the initial campaign as noted in the Insertion
            Order. Agreement may continue thereafter by mutual consent but may
            be terminated by either party for any reason whatsoever. All
            legitimate moneys due to PUBLISHER will be paid during the next
            billing cycle. If PUBLISHER defrauds the system, then payment is
            revoked as determined solely by GoalOfferss.
          </li>
          <li>
            8.) Payment: PUBLISHER will invoice GoalOfferss on a monthly basis
            at the payout rates reflected in the Insertion Order. The invoice
            will reflect delivery of final Qualified Lead numbers that are based
            upon numbers reported by GoalOfferss to PUBLISHER pursuant to the
            terms of this Agreement. In the event GoalOfferss does not receive
            payment from ADVERTISER for any reason including, but not limited
            to, traffic provided by PUBLISHER, GoalOfferss shall have no
            obligation to make payment to PUBLISHER.
          </li>
          <li>
            9.) Payment Term: GoalOfferss shall make all payments to PUBLISHER
            within 30 days of the Invoice Date. All payments made to PUBLISHER
            do not include, and PUBLISHER shall pay, any sales, use or similar
            tax associated with such payment. All past due amounts shall accrue
            interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or
            the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is greater. Parties shall
            keep, maintain and preserve, for the term of this Agreement and for
            one (1) year thereafter, accurate records relating to amounts due
            hereunder (the “Relevant Records”). Either party shall have a right
            at least once per calendar year to audit the Relevant Records of the
            other party for the purpose of verifying fulfillment of party’s
            payment obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Each audit will be
            conducted at a place agreed to by the parties, during the normal
            business hours, with at least ten (10) business days prior written
            notice to party to be audited. Auditing party shall pay the fees and
            expenses of the audit, unless the audit reveals a payment
            discrepancy of more than ten percent (10%) of all payments due in
            any consecutive six (6) month period, in which case audited party
            shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the audit, and shall
            immediately pay to auditing party all amounts found to be due.
